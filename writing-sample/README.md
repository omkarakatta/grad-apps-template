# Writing Sample

Some schools ask for a writing sample.

I had two writing samples because length requirements varied by program.
The first was short -- roughly 10 pages.
The second was long -- roughly 30 pages.
Both were written so that the formatting could be easily changed to fit the program-specific requirements.
