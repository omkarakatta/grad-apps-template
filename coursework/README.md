# Coursework

In addition to your transcript, some programs ask for more detailed description of your courses.
Some programs even ask you to find the most comparable classes at their respective university.
While you would typically fill out a form, some schools ask for a PDF where you list these details.
The `coursework-template.tex` file encourages you to collect as much information about all your courses and produces a PDF file you can upload.
I actually had a markdown file that would be used to populate `coursework-template.tex` because it was easier to copy-paste from a markdown file than from the tex/pdf files.
Furthermore, it was easy to pick-and-choose which courses I wanted to highlight based on the program-specific instructions.
