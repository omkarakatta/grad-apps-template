# Grad Apps Template

Applying to graduate school can be tough.
Staying organized can help ease the struggle.
This repository is meant to be an inspiration for you to create a workflow that enables you to keep track of your application materials and deadlines.
Each folder has a README with how I used this structure.
Modify the structure aggressively to suit your personal needs.

Just to be clear: I'm not advising you to use the structure I used.
I am also not suggesting that using this structure will help you get better outcomes.
My point is that you will likely have a better experience if you're organized.
I am grateful to the people who shared their organization structure with me, so I wanted to share mine with you in case it can help you too.
