# Advice

When I applied to graduate school, I received and sought a lot of advice from many sources: friends, grad students, faculty, the Internet, etc.
I wish I had done a better job of writing down everything.
This would have made it easier to thank all the people to whom I owe my success.
It would have also made it easier to figure out if the advice I was getting was credible or biased somehow.
Everyone has their own experience, and comparing stories can help figure out how much of their experience is relevant for you.
