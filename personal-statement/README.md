# Personal Statements

Some programs ask for diversity/personal statements.
They can be as short as a few sentences or as long as your SOP.
Consider having a short and long version.

This directory is where I wrote a baseline personal statement.
I automated the process of copying `personal-template.tex` to each program-specific directory in `programs/` and tailor the baseline statement as needed.
Tools such as `mustache` and `Makefile` are helpful for automation.
