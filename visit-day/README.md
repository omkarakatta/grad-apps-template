# Visit Days

Some schools may invite you to visit their program.
Some may even reimburse your travel expenses.
I had a separate folder to organize the logistics, e.g., keeping track of taxi, train, and plane receipts.
I also kept the agenda for the various programs' visit days in this directory too.
