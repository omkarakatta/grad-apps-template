## Centralized Record-keeping

Programs ask a lot of information about you.
It can be really tedious to repeatedly answer the same questions.
Having a place where all the answers lie made it easier to quickly make my way through each program's application portal.
For me, this place was `personal-info.md`.

## Other Documents

The application process involves submitting a lot of documents.
Take the time to secure these documents early to avoid scrambling as the deadlines approach.

- CV/Resume
- GRE Score Report (some programs may require you to formally send score reports through CollegeBoard, so I saved the receipts of these orders in this folder)
- Unofficial Transcript(s)
- Official, Ungated Transcript(s) (some programs want official transcripts -- make sure they are ungated so that they can actually access them)
- Diploma(s)
- Fee Waiver Confirmation (some programs provide fee waivers to those who can provably satisfy certain criteria, e.g., participating in some summer program)
- GPA Calculations (some programs ask for your cumulative GPA, major GPA, junior/senior year GPA, and/or other kinds of GPAs)
