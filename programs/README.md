# Programs

Most programs have similar requirements, but some have quirky requests that you need to fill.
This folder helps you keep track of all these peculiarities.

## Centralized Record-keeping

The `program-info.md` is a hub that I used to record all the relevant information about the schools.
Each program had its own section with a dedicated checklist containing what I needed to do to complete the application.
I ordered the program-specific sections so that schools with early deadlines were at the top.
Once the deadline passed, I would move the section to the bottom of the checklist.
Having a single place to update and reference made it easier to see what I had to do.

I also considered using GitHub issues with templates to organize this information.
I faced some complications with my internet connection that made it difficult to diligently update the issues.
So, I resorted to the simpler markdown solution.

## Program-specific Directories

Each program had its own directory containing most, if not all, of the following:

- program-specific SOP
- program-specific writing sample
- program-specific personal statement
- other program-specific application materials

After finishing the application, I would also store

- submission confirmation
- copy of the application (a.k.a. the application proof)
- decision letter
- offer letter
- visit-day information

You may also want to organize the program-specific directories in different ways.
For example, you may want to put these program-specific directories into higher-level ones:

- `to-complete/`: applications you have yet to submit
- `completed/`: applications you have completed
- `shortlist/`: programs can ask you if you're still interested in them
- `waitlist/`: programs can put you on a waitlist
- `accept/`: programs can give you an offer
- `reject/`: programs can reject you
