# Recommendation Letters

There are several letter-writers and several programs.
Keeping track of all these letters and all the deadlines is a bit like a juggling act.
Updating `program-info.md` in the `programs/` directory certainly helped me.
But the people submitting the letters can use all the help they can get.

For each letter-writer, I created a spreadsheet based on `letters-template.csv`.
I shared it with the person submitting the letters via Google Sheets.
We both diligently updated the spreadsheet and stayed in frequent contact to ensure the letters were submitted on time.

I also used this directory to store templates/drafts of reminder emails I would send to the letter-writers and the people submitting the letters.
I also set up notifications to alert me to impending deadlines.
